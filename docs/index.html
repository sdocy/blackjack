				<br/>A full featured BlackJack game that started as a chapter exercise on learncpp.com.  I was amazed at how simple it was to
				capture the most basic rules of BlackJack, so I decided to implement a graphical version in Unity.  My C++ code transferred
				over to Unity and C# very easily and I implemented the rules that had not been part of the exercise on learncpp.com, getting
				blackjack with two cards, and aces worth either 1 or 11.<br/><br/>
				Adding doubling down was very straight-forward, but adding splitting was quite tricky, as I knew it would be.  Instead of
				dealing with a single hand, I had to account for multiple hands.  Even though I had accounted for this and allowed for my
				implementation to be changed to an array-based implementation, it required some refactoring of my code to get an elegant
				design.  And of course I had to make sure that doubling-down after splitting worked correctly<br/><br/>
				Perhaps the trickiest part was figuring out how and where to add appropriate delays for actions like displaying dealt cards
				on the screen.  Being able to follow the action as it unfolds instead of immediately racing to the final result made the game
				feel much more natural and increased the suspense of whether you were going to win or not.  I had used InvokeRepeating()
				before but not StartCoroutinue(), which is what this really called for, in able to be able to use yield to introduce delays at
				specific points in the game.  Getting the proper mix of event-driven code and asynchronous delays was tricky, but it all came
				together eventually.<br/>

			My plans are to eventually combine this with some sort of story-driven trading card game.  Cards would impact the standard
			BlackJack rules, such as increasing or decreasing the total at which a player busts, switching cards with the other player, etc.
			To facilitate testing how much certain rule variations would impact a player's chances of winning, I implemented a simulation
			mode in which the computer would basically play itself, using commonly used rules for when to hit and when to stand.  The
			simulation allows me to run though hundreds of hands quickly and automatically.  Implementing the simulator was especially
			tricky because I had to remove the asynchronous nature of the code which contained delays.  I ended up having to duplicate
			certain functions which triggered asynchronous code and create synchronous versions of them.  The functions are all fairly
			simple, so it's not as bad as it sounds, but I will probably take a look at it again at some point and see if I can come up
			with a better solution.<br/>
